# Financial-Modeling
My project is called "Personal Project 4." https://github.com/jagregg24/Financial-Modeling/blob/main/personal%20project%204.py
It is a personal budget calculator that takes 30% of excess income and invests it in various stocks. It involves a UI and a pie chart to show the user what stocks they are investing in and how much of their money they should invest in those stocks to minimize risk.
